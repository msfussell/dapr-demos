# Dapr demos

Collection of personal [Dapr](https://dapr.io) demos.

> Note, some of these demos require latest version of Dapr, Ingress gateway, Observability components, or cluster-local Redis and Mongo services. To create Kubernetes cluster with all these components on AKS, or quickly configure an existing cluster, consider the [Dapr Cluster Setup](./setup) utility.
